    <h1>List Of Choux Pastry Dishes</h1>
    	<p>Choux pastry, or pâte à choux, is a light 
    	pastry dough that contains only butter, water,
    	flour and eggs. The high moisture content of 
    	the dough causes it to produce steam when cooked,
    	which puffs the pastry.</p>

			  <h3>Tell Me More About Tradition</h3>
			  	<p>Beignets are commonly known in New Orleans 
			  	as a breakfast served with powdered sugar on 
			  	top.They are traditionally prepared right 
			  	before consumption to be eaten fresh and hot. 
			  	Variations of fried dough can be found across 
			  	cuisines internationally; however, the origin 
			  	of the term beignet is specifically French. 
			  	In the United States, beignets have been popular 
			  	within New Orleans Creole cuisine and are 
			  	customarily served as a dessert or in some 
			  	sweet variation. They were brought to New Orleans 
			  	in the 18th century by French colonists,from "the 
			  	old mother country",and became a large part of 
			  	home-style Creole cooking, variations often 
			  	including banana or plantain – popular fruits 
			  	in the port city.</p>

	 	<h2>Bossche Bol</h2>
	 		<p>It is effectively a large profiterole, about 12 
	 		cm (5 in.) in diameter (i.e., somewhat larger than 
	 		a tennis ball), filled with whipped cream and coated 
	 		entirely or almost entirely with (usually dark) 
	 		chocolate.</p>
	 		<p>They are traditionally eaten with the fingers, 
	 		which can be quite messy. The best way to avoid 
	 		spillage is by eating the pastry upside down, so 
	 		that the hard layer of chocolate serves as a 
	 		bottom. It is also possible (though frowned upon 
	 		by traditionalists) to use a knife and fork.</p>

	 	<h2>Chouquette</h2>
	 		<p>A chouquette is a type of viennoiserie 
	 		consisting of a small portion of choux pastry 
	 		sprinkled with pearl sugar and sometimes filled 
	 		with custard or mousse. A chouquette can also 
	 		be dipped in chocolate or covered in chocolate 
	 		chips.</p>
